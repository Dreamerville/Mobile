# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Scenario

### Scenario 1: Retail Mobile App

You are a team responsible for developing a new mobile app for a retail company. The app will allow customers to browse and purchase products, view their order history, and track the status of their deliveries. Additionally, the app will have a loyalty program feature, where customers can earn and redeem points for discounts on future purchases.

## Architectural Decision

### Decision 3: Backend Language

#### Decision

We have decided to use Node.js as the backend language for the retail mobile app.

#### Rationale

1. JavaScript Ecosystem: Node.js leverages the JavaScript ecosystem, allowing us to share code and resources between the backend and frontend, streamlining development.

2. Asynchronous Programming: Node.js excels in handling concurrent requests, which is critical for a retail app with potentially high user traffic.

3. NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM provides a vast library of pre-built packages, simplifying the integration of third-party services and tools.

4. Scalability: Node.js allows for easy horizontal scalability, ensuring that the backend can accommodate increasing demand.

5. Community Support: Node.js has a large and active community that can offer assistance and solutions to potential challenges.

#### Consequences

- JavaScript Skill Requirement: Development teams need strong JavaScript expertise for backend development.

- Dependency on NPM: While NPM provides a wealth of packages, careful management is required to avoid dependency conflicts.

- Long-Term Maintenance: Node.js is known for frequent updates, necessitating long-term maintenance and updates to stay current.

## Business Requirements Met

- The decision aligns with the business requirements of providing a scalable, efficient, and JavaScript-based backend for the retail app.

## User Needs Met

- The decision meets user needs by ensuring a responsive and high-performance backend, enhancing the overall shopping experience.
