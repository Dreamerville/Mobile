# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Scenario

### Scenario 1: Retail Mobile App

You are a team responsible for developing a new mobile app for a retail company. The app will allow customers to browse and purchase products, view their order history, and track the status of their deliveries. Additionally, the app will have a loyalty program feature, where customers can earn and redeem points for discounts on future purchases.

## Architectural Decision

### Decision 6: Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks

#### Decision

We have decided to integrate Firebase, a mobile and web application development platform, as an additional framework for handling authentication, real-time data synchronization, and push notifications in the retail mobile app.

#### Rationale

1. Rapid Development: Firebase provides pre-built features and tools for handling authentication, real-time database updates, and push notifications, saving development time.

2. Real-Time Updates: Firebase's real-time database offers seamless data synchronization, which is crucial for features like order tracking and loyalty point updates.

3. Authentication Services: Firebase Authentication provides secure methods for user sign-up and login, including social login options.

4. Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) offers a reliable and scalable push notification service for notifying users about order updates and exclusive offers.

5. Scalability: Firebase services can scale as the app's user base grows, ensuring performance and reliability.

#### Consequences

- Vendor Lock-In: Integration with Firebase may result in vendor lock-in, limiting flexibility in switching to other services.

- Data Privacy: Firebase services handle sensitive user data, necessitating strict adherence to data privacy regulations.

## Business Requirements Met

- The decision aligns with the business requirements of efficient authentication, real-time updates, and push notifications to enhance the retail app's functionality.

## User Needs Met

- The decision meets user needs for real-time order tracking and timely notifications, enhancing their shopping experience.
