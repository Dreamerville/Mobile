# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Scenario

### Scenario 1: Retail Mobile App

You are a team responsible for developing a new mobile app for a retail company. The app will allow customers to browse and purchase products, view their order history, and track the status of their deliveries. Additionally, the app will have a loyalty program feature, where customers can earn and redeem points for discounts on future purchases.

## Architectural Decision

### Decision 2: UI Framework

#### Decision

We have decided to use a platform-specific UI framework for the retail mobile app. For iOS, we will use SwiftUI, and for Android, we will use Jetpack Compose.

#### Rationale

1. Platform Integration: Platform-specific UI frameworks like SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose offer seamless integration with their respective platforms (iOS and Android). This ensures that the app looks and feels native on each platform.

2. Performance: Platform-specific frameworks are optimized for performance, enhancing the responsiveness and user experience of the app.

3. Latest Features: These frameworks provide access to the latest features and design patterns, allowing us to create modern and visually appealing UIs.

4. Development Efficiency: Despite being platform-specific, SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose streamline UI development, reducing development time and effort.

#### Consequences

- Platform-Specific Development: Development teams need expertise in SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose for iOS and Android development, respectively.

- Maintenance: Separate codebases for UI may require additional maintenance effort.

## Business Requirements Met

- The decision aligns with the business requirements of providing a high-quality and platform-specific user interface for the retail app.

## User Needs Met

- The decision meets user needs for a native and responsive user interface tailored to each platform.
