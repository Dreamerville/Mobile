## Scenario

### Scenario 1: Retail Mobile App

You are a team responsible for developing a new mobile app for a retail company. The app will allow customers to browse and purchase products, view their order history, and track the status of their deliveries. Additionally, the app will have a loyalty program feature, where customers can earn and redeem points for discounts on future purchases. The following requirements must be considered:

1. The retail company wants the app to support offline mode, allowing customers to browse products and view their order history even when they are not connected to the internet. The app should sync data with the server once an internet connection is available.

2. The retail company wants to send push notifications to customers to notify them about order updates, new product arrivals, and exclusive offers. The app should integrate with a push notification service to handle the delivery of notifications.

3. The app needs to integrate with various payment gateways to facilitate secure and convenient transactions for customers. The team should select and integrate a suitable payment gateway or a combination of gateways based on security, ease of use, and compatibility with the app's target platforms.

## Architectural Decision

### Decision 4: Permissions

#### Decision

We will implement a fine-grained permissions system to manage access to specific app features and data.

#### Rationale

1.  Data Security : Fine-grained permissions ensure that sensitive data, such as payment information and order history, is protected and accessible only to authorized users.

2.  Feature Access Control : Different user roles and permissions will allow us to control access to specific app features, ensuring that users see only what is relevant to their role.

3.  Compliance : Fine-grained permissions are essential for complying with data protection regulations and ensuring that user data is handled securely.

4.  Scalability : The permissions system can scale as the app grows, accommodating additional roles and features.

#### Consequences

-  Complexity : Implementing fine-grained permissions requires careful design and development to avoid complexity.

-  Maintenance : Ongoing management of permissions and roles will be necessary to adapt to changing requirements.

-  User Experience : Permissions should be implemented in a way that does not negatively impact the user experience or lead to confusion.
