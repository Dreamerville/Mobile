# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Scenario

### Scenario 1: Retail Mobile App

You are a team responsible for developing a new mobile app for a retail company. The app will allow customers to browse and purchase products, view their order history, and track the status of their deliveries. Additionally, the app will have a loyalty program feature, where customers can earn and redeem points for discounts on future purchases.

## Architectural Decision

### Decision 4: Permissions

#### Decision

We have decided to implement fine-grained permissions for the retail mobile app, allowing users to grant specific permissions related to location, notifications, camera, and device storage.

#### Rationale

1. User Control: Fine-grained permissions empower users to control the data and device features they wish to grant access to, enhancing privacy.

2. Feature Utilization: By requesting permissions on-demand, the app ensures that users only grant access when they interact with relevant features, improving user experience.

3. Security: Granular permissions limit potential misuse of sensitive data and device resources, enhancing overall app security.

4. Compliance: Compliance with platform-specific permission models (e.g., Android's runtime permissions) ensures app acceptance on app stores.

#### Consequences

- User Experience: Appropriate permission requests and explanations must be implemented to ensure a smooth user experience.

- User Trust: Users need to trust that the app requests permissions for legitimate and necessary reasons.

## Business Requirements Met

- The decision aligns with the business requirements of providing a privacy-conscious, secure, and user-controlled app experience.

## User Needs Met

- The decision meets user needs for privacy control and trust, as users can grant permissions selectively and with understanding.
